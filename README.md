# pyFUSE
Python package for creating and running lumped hydrological models, inspired by the paper 
**Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE): A modular framework to diagnose differences between hydrological models** by Clark M. P. et al.

This version is providing the same model structure optionsa as the FUSE implmentation of Clark, but extends the functionalities to make the configuration of the hydrological models NAM and PDM also possible.
